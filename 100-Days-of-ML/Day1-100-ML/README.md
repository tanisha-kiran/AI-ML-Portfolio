Day 1
Topics Learned:
Introduction to Machine Learning
Understanding the ML Development Life Cycle
Setting up environment with Python/Anaconda
Basic Python review: variables, loops, functions

Day 2
Topics Learned:
Introduction to Data Handling & Libraries
NumPy: arrays, broadcasting
Pandas: Series, DataFrames, indexing, filtering
Simple data visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
Reading CSV/Excel files

Day 3
Topics Learned:
Tensors: 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D
Fun facts:
1D tensors = scalars
2D tensors = vectors
3D tensors = matrices
Creating virtual environments using Anaconda
Data Preprocessing: EDA, feature extraction, training/testing models, deploying a small project
Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate Analysis
Feature Engineering basics
Standardisation (Z-score Normalisation): mean=0, std=1
Works well with almost all models (KNN, Logistic Regression, PCA benefit a lot)
Normalisation techniques:
MinMax Scaling (used often in CNNs)
Mean Normalisation
MaxAbs Scaling
Robust Scaling

Day 4

Topics Learned:
More on Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values (SimpleImputer)
Encoding categorical data (Ordinal & Nominal)
ColumnTransformer in Scikit-learn

Day 5
Topics Learned:
Feature Scaling & Transformation techniques
StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, MaxAbsScaler, RobustScaler
Introduction to train-test split & cross-validation
Mini-project: preprocessing a dataset and evaluating a simple model

Day 6
Topics Learned:
Feature Engineering deeper dive
Creating new features
Feature selection basics
Understanding data distribution
Introduction to pipelines in Scikit-learn

Day 7
Topics Learned:
Ordinal Encoding (for ordered columns)
Nominal Encoding (for unordered categorical columns)
ColumnTransformer in Scikit-learn
Handling missing values with SimpleImputer
Fun fact: SimpleImputer(strategy='mean') fills missing values automatically

Day 8
Topics Learned:
Advanced Pipelines
Combining multiple preprocessing steps
Mini-project: building pipeline with Imputer, Encoder, Scaler, Feature Selector
Reviewing ML workflow from preprocessing → training → evaluation

Day 9
Topics Learned:
Creating a basic ML pipeline
SimpleImputer
OneHotEncoder
MinMaxScaler
Feature Selection (top 5 columns)
Using Decision Tree as model
Note: did not drop first column in OHE because Decision Tree is non-linear
